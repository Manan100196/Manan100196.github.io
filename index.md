ST 558 - Blog 1

Hey everyone, I am here to introduce and share relevant information about myself!

My name is Manan Shah, third semester masterâ€™s in financial mathematics student at NC State University. My hometown is Mumbai, India where I have spent 24 years of my life and I am obsessed with this city. I have pursued my under-graduate mechanical engineering degree from University of Mumbai. I will brief about my transition from engineering to finance. After completing my bachelors, I started earning and was looking to invest part of salary. I was confused and my friend suggested to read CFA books to have basic knowledge of finance. I started reading and it was interesting. The subjects were well interlinked and closely related to the real world. That's when, I decided to attempt for CFA level 1 and cleared it successfully. I registered for CFA level 2, but my exams were cancelled thrice due to covid. I had resigned from the job and my masters plan was postponed as well. It was really disturbing and tough times, but I was adamant
to get into finance. Fortunately, during the tough economic time, I secured a job which was into reinsurance sector as financial risk modelling and analysis. That provided me a start and here I am looking to leverage statistical and technical skills in the field of finance. 

Here, I will share and express my thoughts and experience of technical tools and statistical knowledge required for Data Science. I would like to connect with people and learn more. Please correct me if I commit a mistake or am wrong anywhere. 

My idol is Shahrukh Khan, and the reason are not his movies but his struggles and hardwork which made him this successful without any support. My favourite sport
person is Roger Federer because of his consistency though my current favourite tennis player is Rafael Nadal and I enjoy watching F.R.I.E.N.D.S.

Sincerely,
Manan.
