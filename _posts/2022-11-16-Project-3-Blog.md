Project 3 Blog

The third project of ST 558: Data Science for Statisticians involved leveraging machine learning models to predict the number of shares for a 
particular channel based on the features provided. I worked with Rohan Prabhune who is masters in computer science student at North Carolina
State University. 

What would you do differently?

Given an opportunity to work on such a project in a corporate world, I would prefer to comprehend the business and accordingly understand each
variable and what is the impact of these variables. This will aid me in performing EDA of correct variable and find the required pattern of
the variables against the response variable. Also, I would prefer to deploy other types of linear regression models such as exhasutive search,
including the interaction and polynomial terms. The boosting algorithm can be tuned with different pairs of number of trees, interaction depth
and shrinkage parameter.

What was the most difficult part for you?

The challenging part was the github setup. My old laptop which had github setup done by my friend was not working. I used another laptop and
understood the github in more detail than before. The other difficult part was to decide which metric to consider while deciding the winner. 
In the project, RMSE is used but Adj-R2 and other parameter can also be used.

What are your big take-aways from this project?

The big take-aways from this project was I was more comfortable and confident with github and it's command. The automation helped me learn how 
to generalize things in the business with minimum user input. The data pre-processing is the key step before implementing the models for which
one needs to analyze it effeciently.
