What things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?

In the first two semesters, I use to work in Python majorly for my projects. This particular course has aided me developed skills in R. Now, I prefer R 
over pythoin as it has great libraries to build machine learning models. Also, the course has helped me understand the underlying statistics behind machine 
learning models. Finally, through this course I have started using .rmd version instead of .R which is a better way to represent the r code to the business.

Data science (and statistics) is a huge field. What do you hope to do in relation to data science (and statistics) in your future career? 
What aspects/areas do you want to learn more about? 

I am in the third semester of masters in financial mathematics course at NC State University. I have secured a quant job and this course assissted in
clearing coding rounds. My career goal is to leverage technical and statistical skills in the field of finance and this course learning and experience
will be very helpful. This course has provided the base of ML models and I would to comprehend the underlying mathematics and statistics of these model in 
detail.
