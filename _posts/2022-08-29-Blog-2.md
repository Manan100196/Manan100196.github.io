Project 1 Blog

Data preprocessing and manipulation is the most important step in modelling. Incorrect or missing values leads to wrong modelling result which impact negatively 
the business decision. Also, plots give key insights of the preprocessed large dataset, so the further steps can be planned accordingly.

It was great fun and lots of learning while working on the first project of ST 558 - Data Science for Statistics. The project involved pre-processing the raw 
dataset. Later, it involved creating plots using ggplot of key variables in the dataset. The main learning was the use of function and flexibility it can provide.
Also, the nested function created termed as wrapper function in the R script was used to manipulate different files having similar raw dataset. 

I realized that it is very important to have pseudo code as R is a new programming language for me. Also, while using a package, it is important to read and
understand each input parameter options available and for that I realized, I need to read R documentent completely before using the package. This can save time 
and provide thorough understanding. 

I have added my project's html link below and I am open to suggestions or discussions.
