Project 1 Blog

It was great fun and lots of learning while working on the first project of ST 558 - Data Science for Statistics. The project was involved pre-processing the raw 
dataset. Later, I created plot of key variables in the dataset. The main learning was the use of function and flexibility it can provide. Also, the nested
function created termed as wrapper function in the R script was used to manipulate different files having similar raw dataset. 

Data preprocessing and manipulation is the most important step in modelling. Incorrect or missing values leads to wrong modelling result which impact negatively 
the business decision. Also, plots give key insights of the preprocessed large dataset, so the further steps can be planned accordingly. 

I have added my project 1 html file below and I am open to suggestions or discussions.
