ST558-Project2-Group-2H

The project was really interesting and experienced real world corporate dificulties the software development team members encounters while working on same 
project at a same time. I created three functions which are tickers, tickers_from_name and stock_price. Next, I created new variable, two way contigency table
and generated bar plot, line plot and histogram plot. This project made me realize the importance of comprehending the dataset before creating user defined 
function and relevant plots. Being a financial mathematics student, I realized how powerful and important conclusion one can draw using financial data API. This
project helped me distinguish which plots are used when and the variables (quantitative/ qualitative) used for each type of plot.

I worked along with Xi Yang (Cathy) who is a first semester masters in statistics graduate student. We both were new to git but were looking forward to gain sufficient knowledge of it. Thus, I decided to work on main and she did all her work on branch. Once, she confirms her changes, I made sure to merge them on main and update her so she can pull and work on latest file. The challenging part was to determine what type of functions shall we create which can assist us create different type of plots. Since it involved working in a group on a single code, I would first learn git in more detail. Also, instead of commenting everything at the end, I would do it while working on each individual function and plot so that my team member gets more clear idea. 

Overall, it was fun and involved significant learning while working on this project. I thank Cathy for her support and prompt response.
